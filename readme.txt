Project Cantilena

Project Cantilena is the brainchild of Karamjit Singh Bedi, a student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology. It was first showcased during the HackTU 3.0, organised on campus on the 26th and 27th of February, where it won second place among 100+ teams.

It aims to become the next-generation music composition software for professional artists and budding musicians. Cantilena ultimately aims to create an "Auto-complete" suggestion tool for music composers that shall be achieved by applying Optical Music Recognition to music score sheets and then identifying the genre of the incomplete song based on its semantics and its play-style by applying a Parallel RNN-CNN model on the Mel-Spectrogram of the song.
